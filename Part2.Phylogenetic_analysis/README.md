**Phylogenetic analysis of southern-northern oyster species**

Whole genome sequencing (WGS) data of 21 *C. angulata* and 472 *C. gigas* were downloaded from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database under accession numbers PRJNA394055 (Li et al., 2018). WGS data of 261 *C. ariakensis* (69 southern samples and 192 northern samples) was downloaded from the SRA database under accession numbers PRJNA715058 (Wu et al., 2022).
